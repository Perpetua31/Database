(4, 'Dear Mama', 9, 
'[Intro]
You are appreciated

[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I d see her face
Ain t a woman alive that could take my mama s place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we d blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who d think in elementary, hey
I d see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin from the police, that s right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman, it ain t easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There s no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don t you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don t you know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now, ain t nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy, cause the coward wasn t there
He passed away and I didn t cry
Cause my anger wouldn t let me feel for a stranger
They say I m wrong and I m heartless, but all along
I was lookin  for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin
I ain t guilty, cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin  home after work late
You re in the kitchen, tryin to fix us a hotplate
You just workin with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough, you re alone
You re tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there s no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated


[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don t you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don t you know we love ya?

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I m hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there s no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there s a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It s a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there s no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated


[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don t you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don t you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)

(5, 'I Can', 7,
'[Intro: Children s Choir]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
Ill be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I ll be where I wanna be (I ll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who s becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could ve died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I ll be where I wanna be (I ll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I ll be where I wanna be (I ll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I ll be where I wanna be (I ll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who s only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don t pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life s all about smoking weed and ice
You don t wanna be my age and can t read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this


[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I ll be where I wanna be (I ll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I ll be where I wanna be (I ll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you re a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, She s my Queeeeeen


[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I ll be where I wanna be (I ll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I ll be where I wanna be (I ll be where I wanna be)

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you re grown up, so fly, it s like a blessin
But you can t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you re sittin here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn t your fault, wasn t in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listenin, but
But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin
Just as much as you admire bartendin and strippin, baby

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I m finna let it shine
I m finna take y all back to them better times
I m finna talk about my mama if y all don t mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn t give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can t you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said, Mommy, I ma love you til you don t hurt no more
And when I m older, you ain t gotta work no more
And I ma get you that mansion that we couldn t afford
See, you re unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable lady that s makin loot
A livin legend too, just look at what Heaven do
Sent us an angel, and I thank you, Mama

Forrest Gump mama said, Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me, Go to school, get your doctorate
Something to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it s things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me?
Can t you see, you re like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni
Turn one page and there s my mommy
Come on, Mommy, just dance wit me
Let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y all say, Mama
Now everybody answer me, come on

I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second they get up, you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let your friends know (Hey, Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I ma get you a Jag , whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don t gotta be Mother s Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say

You got my pictures on the wall in your room, and
Girls be complaining you keep me boomin
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone

Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue, and

(9, 'Find Your Love', 13, 
'[Verse 1]
I m more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart (Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing s gonna tear us apart

[Verse 2]
I m more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you ll find another (Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)
I ll be the one that you ll remember and

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing s gonna tear us apart

[Verse 3]
It s more than just a mission (Hey, hey, hey)
You hear, but you don t listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (Hey, hey, hey)
And get what you ve been missing

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart

Too many times I ve been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I m done waiting, there s nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving
I bet if I give all my love then nothing s gonna tear us apart

(10, 'Fly', 5, 
'[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win (J.R.), to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, yo
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that d kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin , but I think I m still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, it s strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin at me
But I become Neo when they aimin at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow, they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin and I start risin
Must be surprisin , I m just surmisin
I win, thrive, soar, higher
Higher, higher, more fire


[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin  every time it locks me in
Paintin they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain t got no motherfuckin time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes


[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly');
